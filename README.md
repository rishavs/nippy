# nippy

This is rough outline for a language I am working on.

Core ideas:
Easy: Nippy must be easy to learn and use, above anything else. 
Fast: The goal is to have performance similar to C by leveraging a good compiler backend.
Minimalistic: Nippy will have a small syntax and only those features which I feel are absolutely necessary, will be picked up.
Small: Nippy must produce binaries with no dependencies and small size.
Communal: Nippy places more importance on the community and ecosystm than on language semantics.


What Nippy isnt:
It isnt an all purpose low level programming language. Nippy doesnt aims to be another C/C++
It isnt

Nippy is an application programming language. It is also a full batteries included toolset.
